# Site Configuration

WarpSpeed uses Nginx as its web server. Phusion Passenger is used for Node, Python, and Ruby sites. PHP-FPM is used for PHP sites. Sometimes you need to configure settings within your nginx site config or maybe your php fpm pool config. WarpSpeed provides an easy way to do that without logging into your server.
